# BOLD Public Portal

## Overview
The Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) Portal is a web application and database designed to support the access, querying, and dissemination of DNA barcode data. DNA barcodes are standardized genetic markers used for species identification, with each record uniquely linking sequence data to specimen information, images, and provenance. Built on open-source technologies—including Couchbase, FastAPI, Redis, and Python—the application provides a scalable and high-performance infrastructure for managing barcode data. Its database follows the Barcode Core Data Model (BCDM - https://github.com/DNAdiversity/BCDM), ensuring structured and interoperable data representation.

The BOLD Portal is designed for multi-institutional deployment, enabling data mirroring and supporting data sovereignty requirements. It includes critical functionalities for monitoring and managing DNA reference libraries through National and Institutional Dashboards, facilitating real-time oversight of barcode repositories. Additionally, the system hosts published datasets, allowing users to download and integrate them into local analytical pipelines.

Developed with an API-first architecture, the application provides a robust API that enables seamless extensions without modifications to the core codebase. Released under the AGPL license, the BOLD Portal promotes open access, collaboration, and interoperability within the global biodiversity informatics community.


## Requirements

- Docker
- NGINX
- Python: FastAPI and Socketserver Logger
- Redis and File System Cache
- Couchbase
- Barcode Core Data Model

Dependencies:
- Barcode Core Data Model repository
- SSL Certificates
- Maintenance job to clear File System Cache
  - `find /tmp/bold-public-portal/cache -type f -amin +1440 -delete`

## Local Deployment

Requirements:
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)

```bash
REPO_DIR="barcode-data-portal"

# Spool Up
cd $REPO_DIR
tilt up -f docker/Tiltfile

# Spool Down
cd $REPO_DIR
tilt down -f docker/Tiltfile

# Check Status
# Go to http://localhost:10350/overview
```

## Production Deployment

Check that `.env` is configured correctly and to production values. The following assumes the ansible playbook is not being used and Couchbase is hosted on a different server.

```bash
REPO_DIR="bold-public-portal"

# Spool Up
cd $REPO_DIR
docker build -t fastapi-app -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker build -t socketserver-logging -f docker/Dockerfile.socketserver_logging .
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d

# Spool Down
cd $REPO_DIR
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml down

# Check Status
docker ps -a
```

Alternatively, if the use of screens are required instead of Docker containers:
```bash
systemctl start nginx
systemctl start redis

screen -S fastapi-app
cd $REPO_DIR/src
gunicorn main:app --workers 24 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 127.0.0.1:8000

screen -S socketserver-logging
cd $REPO_DIR/src
python socketserver_logging.py
```
